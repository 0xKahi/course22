multiply strings like `male` or `S` by coefficients, so we need to replace those with numbers.\n","\n","We do that by creating new columns containing *dummy variables*. A dummy variable is a column that contains a `1` where a particular column contains a particular value, or a `0` otherwise. For instance, we could create a dummy variable for `Sex='male'`, which would be a new column containing `1` for rows where `Sex` is `'male'`, and 0 for rows where it isn't.\n","\n","Pandas can create these automatically using `get_dummies`, which also remove the original columns. We'll create dummy variables for `Pclass`, even although it's numeric, since the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` correspond to first, second, and third class cabins - not to counts or measures that make sense to multiply by. We'll also create dummies for `Sex` and `Embarked` since we'll want to use those as predictors in our model.
