In short, this acts as if there's a separate copy of the vector for every row of the matrix, so it divides each row of the matrix by the vector. In practice, it doesn't actually make any copies, and does the whole thing in a highly optimized way, taking full advantage of modern CPUs (or, indeed, GPUs, if we're using them). Broadcasting is one of the most important techniques for making your code concise, maintainable, and fast, so it's well worth studying and practicing.\n\nWe can now create predictions from our linear model, by adding up the rows of the product:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"preds = (t_indep*coeffs).sum(axis=1)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-13T06:00:18.068294Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-13T06:00:18.067838Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-13T06:00:18.082267Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-13T06:00:18.081555Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-13T06:00:18.06826Z"}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at the first few:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"preds[:10]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-13T06:00:18.068294Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-13T06:00:18.067838Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-13T06:00:18.082267Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-13T06:00:18.081555Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-13T06:00:18.06826Z"}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Of course, these predictions aren't going to be any use, since our coefficients are random -- they're just a starting point for our gradient descent process.\n\nTo do gradient descent, we need a loss function.
